# copycat-layout
Copycat Layout uses the node layout in one view to lay out nodes in another view. Most commonly, nodes are matched by name, but can be matched by other (String or Integer) node attributes, too. After the layout, the source and target views are visually aligned for at-a-glance comparison.

Optionally, target nodes that are not in the source view can be left selected and/or gridded off to the side.

For example, if two views share a large number of nodes (but maybe not all nodes), using the Copycat Layout can arrange both views to show the common nodes laid out in the same way, but leave the unmatched nodes off to the right. 

Copycat Layout is an implementation of the old [http://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/layoutsaver layoutSaver app].
